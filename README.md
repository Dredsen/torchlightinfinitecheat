# Torchlight Infinite Cheat / Zoom Mod
This program will automatically grab the camera zoom address for the game and let you override it to whatever you wish it to be, I'd suggest ~8000 for 2x the normal zoom limit.

### It doesn't work anymore!?!!?
The AOB pattern is probably outdated just update the pattern "00 ?? ?? 45 FE FF 33 C2 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 80 3B 45" tons of tutorials on how to grab another one

### What X and Y features?

Auto potions & Skills could either be done by basic OCR or just grabbing the addresses

Auto pickup can be done by making a new thread and having it always sending the 'a' key button press (or grab the autopick and force it to always be true)

## Installation

Grab the latest executable from releases or compile the code using Visual Studio 2022 

```bash
  New Project > Console App C++ > Copy&Paste code > Build > Build Solution
```
